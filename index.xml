      <description>Overview Evaluate the risk and return of 10 stocks of The World&amp;rsquo;s Biggest Technology Companies 5 years ago to date based on annual Sharpe Ratios. Create a tool that functions to provide stock price predictions from companies that have the highest annual sharpe ratio evaluation results in previous evaluations. Machine learning with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model is used to predict stock prices. All datasets are provided from Yahoo! Finance&amp;rsquo;s API.</description>

      <description>Create a tool that functions to provide rental price predictions for various properties based on the features possessed by the property. Machine learning regression model is used to predict property rental rates. Using data sets of San Francisco,CA property rental price. Code and Resources Used Python Version: 3.10.3
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, math Dataset source: Datacamp case study
Processing Data After collect Dataset, I need to check and clean up the dataset to make sure no missing and anomaly values on Dataset before creating a Machine Learning model.</description>

      <description>Create a tool that has a function to evaluate and classify every credit card transaction submitted whether it is valid or fraudulent. A tool made using Machine Learning with a 100% accuracy rate to avoid fraud and laundering that can harm Customers and Bank. Using data sets published by UCI Machine Learning Repository (Credit Approval Data Set). The Machine Learning model used is Logistic Regression with parameter optimization, maximum iterations and tolerance values, using Grid Search Cross Validation to produce model with the best performance.</description>
